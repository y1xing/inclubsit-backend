Performing Arts,4,"Performing Arts and Culture clubs are the place to be for students pursuing excellence in music, dance, and theatre. The clubs perform at various internal and external gigs and come together for the annual showcase performance, ExpresSIT. Workshops of various art forms will also be organised during Arts and Culture Week. These events create awareness about the arts and adds vibrancy to the SIT campus life.

Through the years, enthusiastic and passionate SITizens have worked alongside the Student Life division to create an environment that is conducive for artistic expression. Their love for arts and culture has driven them to be resourceful in seeking out training and competitive opportunities and honing their technical and performing capacities. Our 15 arts groups run the gamut from popular dance and music styles to introspective and classical pursuits."
Sports,5,"In addition to the student recreational sports clubs, there are also 44 competitive (male and female) varsity teams. Through trainings and competitions, student athletes forge friendships, pursue their sporting interests, compete
at the tertiary level both locally and internationally, as well as build character and leadership skills. 

Apart from striving for sporting excellence, SIT also promotes healthy lifestyle and well-being of all students through sports activities and programmes.

A key event is the annual Inter-Cluster Games (ICG) that brings the larger SIT community together, where students, academic staff and alumni come together and compete with one another in a variety of sports."
